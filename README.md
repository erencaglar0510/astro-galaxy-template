## How To Extend

### Authentication
Authentication for now is just simple sign-in process. However, in production, I recommened adding email verification process as user can't spam with bot account. Email verification can be easy to setup with Sendgrid, Mailchimp. 

#### Verification Flow
##### Create-account
Make a new API route -> Create A Session (collection here for example) In Database -> Store verification email, password and verification number -> Send verification number to user with email service -> Request User To Verify -> If Verification Number are same, delete the session and store the email and password back in user collection. 

#### Log-In ( [...astroauth].ts )
Remove the hook that if account on exist, create a new account. 

### Database
If you need relational database or schema typed-ORM, I recommened [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/).
